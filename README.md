My invention is an advanced intruder detection system based in Singapore, utilizing both graphical analysis and real-time monitoring to identify and response to a security breach efficiently. By integrating a monitoring system with graphical analysis, the solution provides a strong protection against intrusions while minimizing false alarms. Additionally, it also has the capability to illustrate an intrusion trend in Singapore, by age groups and year, contributing to efforts to reduce intruder-related crime rates. Through this novel and innovative approach, the system offers enhanced security measures for the specific challenges of the urban environment in Singapore. This sole purpose of such a combination of features ensures quick detection and response to security threats while providing valuable insights into intrusion patterns for proactive crime prevention strategies.
